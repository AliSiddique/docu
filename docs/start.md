# Get Started

This is a **pre-configured Docusaurus starter template** for i18n docs & posts using Docusaurus `v2.0.0-rc.1`, Typescript, Sass, Local Search etc.

A live demo build directly from this repository is deployed on [docusaurus-boilerplate.vercel.app](https://docusaurus-boilerplate.vercel.app) which means you can start a docs site exactly like the demo out of the box.

You are viewing the latest version of the template demo and neccessary docs to help you quickly start a docs site. Try browse around this site to see the pre-configed features, full feature list can be find under [Boilerplate Features](./features.md)
